At the size, the only things offered were SmartTVs. Now to get the most out of it, I'd need to give our Wifi password to it, sigh. Won't happen, for these simple reasons: Smart TVs are, software wise, niche devices. With an OS that is seldom, if at all maintained. Connecting unmaintained devices to the Internet is not very safe. (And the people that know how to keep such things at least partially safe, seldom enjoy all the firewall setup, but that's a personal observation.) The Smart TV supports some, but not all of our usage cases. Again, it's a nice device, that is proprietary so it has a relative small selection of apps to run on it, and these are seldom if at all maintained. So to cover everything you need something like an Amazon FireTV anyways, now if you need that anyways, why use the inferior and unsafe like the TV's services? And that leads to the question, why do manufacturers think that adding an unloved piece of software to their TVs is a great idea?"},{"tags":"author","title":"about yacc143","url":"yacc143.html","text":"Old-style nerd.
