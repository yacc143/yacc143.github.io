&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart TVs are, software wise, niche devices. With an OS that is
  seldom, if at all maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting unmaintained devices to the Internet is not very
  safe. &lt;em&gt;(And the people that know how to keep such things at least
  partially safe, seldom enjoy all the firewall setup, but that's a
  personal observation.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smart TV supports some, but not all of our usage cases. Again,
  it's a nice device, that is proprietary so it has a relative small
  selection of apps to run on it, and these are seldom if at all
  maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to cover everything you need something like an Amazon FireTV
  anyways, now if you need that anyways, why use the inferior and
  unsafe like the TV's services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that leads to the question, why do manufacturers think that adding
an unloved piece of software to their TVs is a great idea?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
